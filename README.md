From about 1880 to about 1925, many of the road theaters of America were organized into numerous theatre circuits.  These were collections of theaters that banded together for their managerial efficiency.  The two most prominent circuits of the era was the biggest, baddest circuit, The Theatrical Syndicate.  Its competitor and eventual conqueror was the Shubert Brothers.  The Syndicate reigned supreme from its founding in 1896 until about 1905.  The Shuberts organization became a force in about 1900, and by 1910 had surpassed the Syndicate and broken its hold on America.

But these two theaters were only the largest.  Across the country, hundreds of other theaters banded together into their own circuits, ranging in size from just two to many hundreds.

This website collects information on all these theaters and their circuits.  Identified so far are over 2,000 member theaters, and over two hundred circuits.
